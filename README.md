# QA automation with Python & Selenium 101

## Module 00 - Environment setup

Students need to prepare the following environment on their computers:

* Install Python 3 on your computer from https://www.python.org/downloads/;
* Text editor of choice, preferably [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/);
* Install & configure source control system of choice (or git).

**NOTES:**

* Students should be prepared before the first Module since the
  training does not intend to focus on installation related issues!
* Students must be familiar with their tools of choice, e.g. they need to know
  how to use the IDE or text editor, how to search files, how to search for
  particular text, etc;
* Instructor may be using different text editor and operating system and may not be
  able to help with matters related to any particular tool if they are not obvious
  enough;
* Students are advised to use the same tools so they can help each other;
  Preferably the same tools are used inside the company as well;
* Student must read all preparation materials before class begins;
* Each Module begins with review of homework from previous Module;
* Classes will explain the theory from the preparation section with examples
  and focus on writing programs to solidify the knowledge;
* Each module is scheduled to take 1 week (total of 3 hrs) of onsite training;
* All homework needs to be done by COB Friday so that Instructor can review and
  provide feedback on it!
